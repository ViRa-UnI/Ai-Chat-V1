## Introduction

The AI Chat Assistant is a web application that leverages OpenAI's conversational AI to deliver a user-friendly chatting experience. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates OpenAI's API for intelligent conversation handling.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You will also need MongoDB set up either locally or in the cloud for the database.

## Features

- Secure user registration and login.
- Real-time AI chat interface.
- Personalization settings for chat preferences and themes.
