# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the steps required to deploy the AI Chat Assistant Web Application using the MERN stack and OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the deployment process, ensure you have the following:

- Access to a MongoDB database instance.
- Node.js and npm installed on your deployment server.
- Access to the OpenAI API with an API key.
- A cloud service or server where the application will be deployed.

## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository to your server or local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install the server dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Navigate to the `client` directory and install the client dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=your_preferred_port
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

2. Replace `your_preferred_port`, `your_mongodb_uri`, `your_jwt_secret`, and `your_openai_api_key` with your actual configuration values.

## Building the Client

1. In the `client` directory, build the React application by running:

```
npm run build
```

2. This will create a `build` folder containing the production build of the client application.

## Running the Server

1. Navigate back to the root directory.
2. Start the server by running:

```
npm start
```

3. The server will serve the client application from the `client/build` directory.

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment

1. Transfer the entire project directory to your server.
2. Follow the Environment Setup and Configuration steps on your server.
3. Start the application using the Running the Server instructions.

### Docker Deployment

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your server.
2. Use the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to build and run the application.

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

3. The application will be running in a Docker container and accessible via the port specified in the `.env` file.

### Cloud Service Deployment

1. Choose a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
2. Follow the provider's instructions for deploying a Node.js application and MongoDB instance.
3. Use the provided `ci-cd.yml` file to set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Maintenance

Regularly update the application dependencies, apply security patches, and monitor the application's performance. Set up logging and alerting to be notified of any issues.

## Conclusion

After following these steps, the AI Chat Assistant Web Application should be successfully deployed and accessible to users. For detailed technical documentation, refer to the `docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
